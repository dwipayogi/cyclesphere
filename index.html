            <h4>Road Bikes</h4>
            <p>
              Designed for speed and distance on paved roads, road bikes are
              perfect for long-distance riders, speed enthusiasts, and
              commuters. They have lightweight frames, thin tires, and
              handlebars that curve under for a streamlined riding position.

            <h4>Mountain Bikes</h4>
            <p>
              Built for rugged trails and off-road riding, mountain bikes have
              strong frames, wide tires, and high-traction tread for stability
              and control on rough terrain. They also feature shock-absorbing
              suspension systems for comfort during adventurous rides.

            <h4>Hybrid Bikes</h4>
            <p>
              Combining the best of road and mountain bikes, hybrid bikes are
              versatile options for city riding, light trail riding, or
              commuting. They have medium-width tires, a comfortable upright
              riding position, and often include cargo racks or fenders.
